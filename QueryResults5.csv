</code></pre>

<p>As you see, we create a buffer of random data, with the size being <code>x</code> megabytes where <code>x</code> is read from the command line. Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 <code>popcount</code> intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is <code>unsigned</code>, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is <code>uint64_t</code>. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.</p>

<h2>The (absolutely crazy) results</h2>

<p>I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):</p>

<pre><code>g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the results on my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Haswell</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29#Desktop_processors"" rel=""noreferrer"">Core i7-4770K</a> CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running <code>test 1</code> (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):</p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   <strong>26.113&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   <strong>13.8003&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As you see, the throughput of the <code>uint64_t</code> version is <strong>only half</strong> the one of the <code>unsigned</code> version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried <code>clang++</code> (Ubuntu <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang"" rel=""noreferrer"">Clang</a> version 3.4-1ubuntu3):</p>

<pre><code>clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test
</code></pre>

<p>Result: <code>test 1</code></p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   <strong>26.3267 GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   <strong>15.3986 GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. <em>But now it gets super strange.</em> I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant <code>1</code>, so I change:</p>

<pre><code>uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for <code>g++</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   <strong>20.5944&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   <strong>20.6139&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the <code>unsigned</code> <strong>got even slower</strong>! It dropped from <code>26</code> to <code>20 GB/s</code>, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a <strong>deoptimization</strong>. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to <code>clang++</code> with the new version:</p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   <strong>15.4884&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   <strong>15.4906&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Wait, what?</em> Now, both versions dropped to the <strong>slow</strong> number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in <strong>both</strong> cases for Clang!</p>

<p>I asked a colleague with an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_%28microarchitecture%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ivy Bridge</a> CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.</p>

<h2>More madness, please!</h2>

<p>Take the first example (the one with <code>atol(argv[1])</code>) and put a <code>static</code> before the variable, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;
</code></pre>

<p>Here are my results in g++:</p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   <strong>26.4306 GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   <strong>20.5811 GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Yay, yet another alternative</em>. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with <code>u32</code>, but we managed to get <code>u64</code> at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! <strong>On my collegue's PC, the <code>u64</code> version became even faster than the <code>u32</code> version, yielding the fastest result of all.</strong> Sadly, this only works for <code>g++</code>, <code>clang++</code> does not seem to care about <code>static</code>.</p>

<h2>My question</h2>

<p>Can you explain these results? Especially:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can there be such a difference between <code>u32</code> and <code>u64</code>?</li>
<li>How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger <em>less optimal code</em>?</li>
<li>How can the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword make the <code>u64</code> loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a <strong>100% difference</strong> in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?</p>

<p>Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses <code>lea</code>. Some versions use <code>jb</code> to jump, others use <code>jne</code>. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?</p>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

<p>No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops <em>every</em> detail can matter, <em>even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code</em>. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a <em>100%</em> difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.</p>

"273695","","1178","572698","<p>I've been using a local git repository interacting with my group's CVS repository for several months, now.  I've made an almost neurotic number of branches, most of which have thankfully merged back into my trunk.  But naming is starting to become an issue.  If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.</p>

<p>I did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a / in the name, i.e., topic/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.</p>

<p>What are some best practices for naming git branches?</p>

<p>Edit:
Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.
I do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)
As an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.  (I've seen too much weirdness interacting with CVS if I try to continue to use the same branch at that point.)</p>

<p>I have a <code>UIView</code> with <code>UITextField</code>s that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Allow scrolling of the contents of the <code>UIScrollView</code> to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically ""jump"" (by scrolling up) or shortening</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know that I need a <code>UIScrollView</code>.  I've tried changing the class of my <code>UIView</code> to a <code>UIScrollView</code> but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.  </p>

<p>Do I need both a <code>UIView</code> and a <code>UIScrollView</code>?  Does one go inside the other?</p>

<p>What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?</p>

<p>Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.</p>

<p>Note: the <code>UIView</code> (or <code>UIScrollView</code>) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (<code>UITabBar</code>), which needs to function as normal.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.  </p>

<p>I've got it working where I change the frame size of the <code>UIScrollView</code> when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using: </p>

<pre><code>-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField { 
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x, 
                     scrollView.frame.origin.y, 
scrollView.frame.size.width,
scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   //resize
}

-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
   //keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x, 
       scrollView.frame.origin.y, 
     scrollView.frame.size.width,
      scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); //resize

<p>I had created a new project with just a <strong>MainActivity</strong>.

<p>When I try to run the project it cannot compile so I added:</p>

<pre><code>compile files('libs/gson-2.2.3.jar')

<p>to the dependencies in de .gradle file. After that it compiles correctly but when running the application I get a <code>ClassDefNotFoundException</code>.</p>

<p>My select box is the following.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Select id=""mySelect"" size=""9""&gt; &lt;/Select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) <code>.val('whatever')</code> did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both <code>.append</code> and <code>.val</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end()
.append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset. This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons. <code>.focus()</code> was closer, but the option did not appear selected like it does with <code>.selected= ""true""</code>. Nothing is wrong with my existing code - I am just trying to learn jQuery.</p>

<pre><code>var mySelect = document.getElementById('mySelect');
mySelect.options.length = 0;
mySelect.options[0] = new Option (""Foo (only choice)"", ""Foo"");
mySelect.options[0].selected=""true"";

<p>EDIT: selected answer was close to what I needed. This worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').children().remove().end()
.append('&lt;option selected value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;') ;

<li><a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout-index.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>git checkout-index</code></a> alludes to this functionality but starts with ""Just read the desired tree into the index..."" which I'm not entirely sure how to do.</li>

</ol>

<p>None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to <code>svn export</code> might be option 1, because both those require the target directory to be empty first.

"10168686","10169025","1709","198649","<p>One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"" rel=""noreferrer"">image processing</a>. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>'cans'</strong> (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the <em>green rectangle</em> with scale and rotation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/irQtR.png"" alt=""Template matching""></p>

<p>Some constraints on the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>
<li>The <em>can</em> could have any <em>scale</em> or <em>rotation</em> or even orientation (within reasonable limits).</li>
<li>The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).</li>
<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the <em>can</em>!</li>
<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).</li>
<li>The <em>can</em> could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.</li>
<li>There could be no <em>can</em> at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>
</ul>

<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Byw82.png"" alt=""Total fail""></p>

<p>I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>

<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using <a href=""http://opencv.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenCV</a> library.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>Changing color domain from RGB to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV"" rel=""noreferrer"">HSV</a> and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ktdAB.png"" alt=""Binarized image"">  </li>
<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>
<li>Using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector"" rel=""noreferrer"">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F9319.png"" alt=""Contour detection""></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0123725380"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> awesome book on feature extraction and called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform"" rel=""noreferrer"">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>
<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>
<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".</li>
<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wxrT1.png"" alt=""GHT""></p>

<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong>! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.</li>
<li>It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)</li>
<li>Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.</li>
<li>In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you help me improve my <strong>specific</strong> algorithm, using <strong>exclusively OpenCV</strong> features, to resolve the <strong>four specific</strong> issues mentioned?</p>

<p>I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()

<p>A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it ""a dramatic design flaw"" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: </p>

<p>Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a():
...     print(""a executed"")
...     return []
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;            
&gt;&gt;&gt; def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print(x)
... 
a executed
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or ""together"" with it?</p>

<p>Doing the binding inside the function would mean that <code>x</code> is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the <code>def</code> line would be ""hybrid"" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.</p>

<p>The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.</p>

It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times <em>less productive</em> with Vim.</p>

<p>The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using alternatively left and right
hands is the <strong>fastest</strong> way to use the
keyboard. </li>
<li>Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.</p>

<p><strong>Copy/Cut &amp; paste.</strong> I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press <kbd>Shift</kbd>  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> copies, you move the cursor and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> pastes.</p>

<p>With Vim it's horrible:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>yy</code></strong> to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)</li>
<li><strong><code>[number xx]yy</code></strong> to copy <code>xx</code> lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do <strong><code>[number xx]dd</code></strong> then <strong><code>u</code></strong> to undo!</li>
</ul>

<p>Another example? <strong>Search &amp; replace.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPad"" rel=""noreferrer"">PSPad</a>: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> then type what you want you search for, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
<li>In Vim: <strong><code>/</code></strong>, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put <strong><code>\</code></strong> before <em>each</em> special character, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.</p>

<p>NB : <strong>I've already read the Vim <a href=""http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">cheat</a> <a href=""http://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">sheet</a></strong> :)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <em>Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing.</em> It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack&nbsp;Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.</p>

<p><strong>The Experiment:</strong> Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. <em>""Use a transaction!""</em>), I thought it best to write some C code and <em>actually measure</em> the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the <a href=""http://www.toronto.ca/open/datasets/ttc-routes"" rel=""noreferrer"">complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto</a></li>
<li>My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.</li>
<li>The code is compiled with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Visual C++</a> 2005 as ""Release"" with ""Full Optimization"" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).</li>
<li>I'm using the SQLite ""Amalgamation"", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Let's write some code!</em></p>

<p><strong>The Code:</strong> A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this ""baseline"" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:</p>

<p>By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    ...

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 38.03
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to <strong>23,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using a Prepared Statement</h2>

<p>Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using <code>sqlite3_bind_text</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();

sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"");
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t"");   /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Branch */
    sVR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Version */
    sST = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Stop Number */
    sVI = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Vehicle */
    sDT = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Date */
    sTM = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);

    sqlite3_step(stmt);

    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

printf(""Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\n"", n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);

sqlite3_finalize(stmt);
sqlite3_close(db);

return 0;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 16.27
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call <code>sqlite3_clear_bindings</code> and <code>sqlite3_reset</code>), but we've more than doubled our performance to <strong>53,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</h2>

<p>By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting <code>synchronous = OFF</code>, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.41
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to <strong>69,600 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>

<p>Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</code>. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.50
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little slower than the previous optimization at <strong>64,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF <em>and</em> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>

<p>Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.00
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fantastic! We're able to do <strong>72,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using an In-Memory Database</h2>

<p>Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:</p>

<pre><code>#define DATABASE "":memory:""
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 10.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform <strong>79,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Refactoring C Code</h2>

<p>Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra <code>char*</code> assignment operations in the <code>while</code> loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of <code>strtok()</code> directly into <code>sqlite3_bind_text()</code>, and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:</p>

<pre><code>pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 8.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform <strong>96,700 inserts per second.</strong> I think it's safe to say that this is <em>plenty fast</em>. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary (so far)</h2>

<p><em>I hope you're still with me!</em> The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go <strong>from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX</h2>

<p>Before we start measuring <code>SELECT</code> performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:</p>

<p><strong>Create Index then Insert Data</strong></p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
...
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 18.13
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Insert Data then Create Index</strong></p>

<pre><code>...
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.66
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. <strong>Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.</p>

"2283937","2350498","1344","78256","<p>As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.</p>

<p>When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.</p>

<p>Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information for Bounty</strong></p>

<p>I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.</p>

<p>In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  </p>

<p>In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to Everyone</strong></p>

<p>This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.</p>

<p>As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.</p>

"1866794","2071812","1251","233460","<p>A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.</p>

<p>For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a <code>User</code>, a <code>Company</code> and an <code>Address</code> domain class - and probably somewhere a <code>UserManager</code>, a <code>CompanyManager</code> and an <code>AddressManager</code> would pop up that handles those things.</p>

<p>So can you tell what those <code>UserManager</code>, <code>CompanyManager</code> and <code>AddressManager</code> do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.</p>

<p>The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the <code>UserManager</code>'s job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a <code>UserShepherd</code>.</p>

<p>Or maybe the <code>UserManager</code>'s job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a <code>UserRecordsClerk</code>.</p>

<p>Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.</p>

<p>I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly <strong>one</strong> thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.</p>

<p>Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a <em>factory</em>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)</li>
<li>Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown</li>
<li>Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)</li>
<li><p>Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects</p></li>
<li><p>etc etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?</p>

<p>P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: <a href=""http://www.bright-green.com/blog/2003_02_25/naming_java_classes_without_a.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'</a></p>

I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't <em>want</em> Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:</p>

<pre><code>var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!
</code></pre>

<p>We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.</p>

<p>I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.</p>

<p>Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.</p>

<p>I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using?</p>

</div>
</p>

<p>The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.</p>

<p>For anything inside the content div, setting <code>top: 0;</code> will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting <code>header</code> inside <code>content</code> will not allow this to work.</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the <code>table</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Elements inside the content <code>div</code> will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the <code>div</code> will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside <code>#content</code> would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.</p>

<li>tinyint, varchar fields containing the values 0/1,</li>

<p>Considering that Node.js can be run almost out-of-the-box on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amazon's EC2</a> instances, I am trying to understand what type of problems require Node.js as opposed to any of the mighty kings out there like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PHP</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ruby</a>. I understand that it really depends on the expertise one has on a language, but my question falls more into the general category of: When to use a particular framework and what type of problems is it particularly suited for?</p>

"16621738","16621778","1275","86776","<p>I made a comment yesterday on an answer where someone had used <code>[0123456789]</code> in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"" rel=""noreferrer"">regular expression</a> rather than <code>[0-9]</code> or <code>\d</code>. I said it was probably more efficient to use a range or digit specifier than a character set.</p>

<p>I decided to test that out today and found out to my surprise that (in the C# regex engine at least) <code>\d</code> appears to be less efficient than either of the other two which don't seem to differ much. Here is my test output over 10000 random strings of 1000 random characters with 5077 actually containing a digit:</p>

<pre><code>Regular expression \d           took 00:00:00.2141226 result: 5077/10000
Regular expression [0-9]        took 00:00:00.1357972 result: 5077/10000  63.42 % of first
Regular expression [0123456789] took 00:00:00.1388997 result: 5077/10000  64.87 % of first
</code></pre>

<p>It's a surprise to me for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would have thought the range would be implemented much more efficiently than the set.</li>
<li>I can't understand why <code>\d</code> is worse than <code>[0-9]</code>. Is there more to <code>\d</code> than simply shorthand for <code>[0-9]</code>?</li>

This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.</p>

<p>I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.</p>

<p>I know one method of doing this is to use the <code>String.format</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91239
</code></pre>

<p>which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: </p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91230
</code></pre>

<p>Another method is to use the <code>DecimalFormatter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91238
</code></pre>

<p>However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:</p>

"35062852","35064297","1958","286755","<p>I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>npm</code> &amp; <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li>
<li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which does it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. </li>
<li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. </li>
<li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").</li>
<li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href=""https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/"" rel=""noreferrer"">AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Questions:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><em>What is <code>webpack</code> &amp; <code>webpack-dev-server</code>?</em> Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. <em>What's the difference?</em></li>
<li><em>Where would you use <code>browserify</code>? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports?</em> </li>
<li><em>When would you use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins?</em></li>

You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either <code>2</code> or <code>4</code>. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of <code>2048</code>.</p>

<p>One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.</p>

<p>My current algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values <code>2</code> and <code>4</code>, that is, I try to have <code>2</code> and <code>4</code> tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.</p>

<p>But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?</p>

<p>If you want a custom dialog, you can instead display an Activity as a dialog instead of using the Dialog APIs. Simply create an activity and set its theme to Theme.Holo.Dialog in 
the <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> manifest element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Holo.Dialog"" &gt;

</code></pre>

<p>I am supporting the following, and I can't using something greater than 10 for the min:</p>

<pre><code>minSdkVersion 10
targetSdkVersion 19
</code></pre>

<p>In my styles I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Base application theme. --&gt;
    &lt;style name=""AppTheme"" parent=""Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar""&gt;

<p>And in my manifest I have this for the activity:</p>

"354883","","1110","1218357","<p>The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38508/whats-the-best-way-to-return-multiple-values-from-a-function-in-python"">tupling</a>.</p>
<h3>Option: Using a tuple</h3>
<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>
<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>
<h3>Option: Using a dictionary</h3>
<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}
</code></pre>
<p>(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)</p>
<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,</p>
<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>
<h3>Option: Using a class</h3>
<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>
<pre><code>class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<p>In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.</p>
<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>
<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [&quot;y0&quot;, &quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python Reference Manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Option: Using a <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">dataclass</a> (Python 3.7+)</h3>
<p>Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:</p>
<pre><code>@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<h3>Option: Using a list</h3>
<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:</p>
<pre><code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code></pre>
<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.</p>
<p>A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable"" rel=""noreferrer"">mutable</a>, whereas tuples are not.</p>
<p>I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

<p>Or instead of using a function, let's say <code>testFunc()</code>, like this:</p>

<p>we have to write:</p>

<h1>How do you solve this problem?</h1>
<p><em>I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.</em></p>
<h2>Solution 1</h2>
<p>Float the parent.</p>

<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;

  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?</p>
<h2>Solution 2</h2>
<p>Give the parent an explicit height.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;

  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.</p>
<h2>Solution 3</h2>
<p>Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Straightforward to code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.</p>
<h2>Solution 4</h2>
<p>Set parent to <code>overflow: auto</code>.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Doesn't require extra div.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Seems like a hack - that's not the <code>overflow</code> property's stated purpose.</p>

My question is: (Please refer to my rephrased question at the bottom)</p>
<p>PS: I am not sure if this helps:</p>
<p>Disassembly for the first loop basically looks like this (this block is repeated about five times in the full program):</p>
<pre><code>movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+20h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+10h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+30h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+30h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+20h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]
</code></pre>
<p>Each loop of the double loop example produces this code (the following block is repeated about three times):</p>
<pre><code>addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+30h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+30h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+28h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+38h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+30h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+40h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+40h],xmm0
</code></pre>
<p>The question turned out to be of no relevance, as the behavior severely depends on the sizes of the arrays (n) and the CPU cache. So if there is further interest, I rephrase the question:</p>
<p><strong>Could you provide some solid insight into the details that lead to the different cache behaviors as illustrated by the five regions on the following graph?</strong></p>
<p><strong>It might also be interesting to point out the differences between CPU/cache architectures, by providing a similar graph for these CPUs.</strong></p>

It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors.  Not sure where to go from here; and</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.msweet.org/projects.php?Z1"" rel=""noreferrer"">Htmldoc</a>: this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me.</li>

<ol>
<li>I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt(double)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Math.sqrt()</code></a>

<p><sub>Note: I'm using this function in many <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Project Euler</a> problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>I've tried the different solutions to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>After exhaustive testing, I found that adding <code>0.5</code> to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""noreferrer"">fast inverse square root</a> was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/38426/bobbyshaftoe"">BobbyShaftoe</a>, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.</li>
<li>Newton's method was a good bit slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.  This is probably because <code>Math.sqrt()</code> uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.</li>

<p>Update 4:</p>
<p>I found that there <em><strong>wasn't any</strong></em> <em>pg_hba.conf</em> file (only file <em>pg_hba.conf.sample</em>), so I modified the sample and renamed it (to remover the .sample). Here are the contents:</p>

<p>Update 6:</p>
<p>This seems odd:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; egrep 'listen|port' /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf
egrep: /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf: No such file or directory

/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample
/usr/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample

<p>So I did this:</p>
<pre><code>egrep 'listen|port' /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample
#listen_addresses = 'localhost'        # what IP address(es) to listen on;
#port = 5432                # (change requires restart)
                # supported by the operating system:
                #   %r = remote host and port
</code></pre>
<p>So I tried this:</p>

<p>On Android 7 and lower everything works, I do not set <code>android:usesCleartextTraffic</code> in Manifest (and setting it to <code>true</code> does not help, that is the default value anyway), neither do I use Network Security Information. If I call <code>NetworkSecurityPolicy.getInstance().isCleartextTrafficPermitted()</code>, it returns <code>false</code> for Android 8, <code>true</code> for older version, using the same apk file.
I tried to find some mention of this on Google info about Android O, but without success.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16 pixels whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full-blown widescreen desktop.</p>

<p>How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using <code>em</code>, but this doesn't scale either.</p>

<p>My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the <code>px</code> <code>font-size</code> of <code>.menuItem</code> among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, <code>22px</code> works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and <code>16px</code> is more appropriate.)</p>

<p>I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as <em>well</em> as having extra breakpoints, otherwise, I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100pixels decrease in width to control the text.</p>

</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>What is wrong in this selector and how do I correct it?</p>

<p>Thanks to the comments, I figured out that the element has to be the first child of its parent to get selected which is not the case that I have. I have the following structure, and this rule fails as mentioned in the comments:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>.home .red:first-child {
    border: 1px solid red;
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class=""home""&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;blah&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;p class=""red""&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=""red""&gt;second&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=""red""&gt;third&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=""red""&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>How can I target the first child with class <code>red</code>?</p>

<p>Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/8928476/282110"">Jon Skeet's <em>excellent</em> analysis</a> shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using <code>int</code> types inside the Fibo method instead of <code>long</code> types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.</p>

"937313","938657","1122","406339","<p>I want to get <code>fling</code> gesture detection working in my Android application.</p>

<p>What I have is a <code>GridLayout</code> that contains 9 <code>ImageView</code>s. The source can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/selmanon/apps-for-android/blob/master/Photostream/src/com/google/android/photostream/GridLayout.java"" rel=""noreferrer"">Romain Guys's Grid Layout</a>.</p>

<p>That file I take is from Romain Guy's <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/apps-for-android/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Photostream application</a> and has only been slightly adapted.</p>

<p>For the simple click situation I need only set the <code>onClickListener</code> for each <code>ImageView</code> I add to be the main <code>activity</code> which implements <code>View.OnClickListener</code>. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a <code>fling</code>. I presume this is because it may span <code>views</code>?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If my activity implements
<code>OnGestureListener</code> I don't know how to
set that as the gesture listener for
the <code>Grid</code> or the <code>Image</code> views that I
add.</p>

<pre><code>public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If my activity implements
<code>OnTouchListener</code> then I have no
<code>onFling</code> method to <code>override</code> (it has
two events as parameters allowing me
to determine if the fling was
noteworthy).</p>

<pre><code>public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If I make a custom <code>View</code>, like <code>GestureImageView</code> that extends <code>ImageView</code> I don't know how to tell the activity that a <code>fling</code> has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this <code>listener</code>? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.</p>

<pre><code>// Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());
        // don't accept the fling if it's too short
        // as it may conflict with a button push
        if (Math.abs(dx) &gt; MAJOR_MOVE &amp;&amp; Math.abs(velocityX) &gt; Math.absvelocityY)) {
            if (velocityX &gt; 0) {
                moveRight();
            } else {
                moveLeft();
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings?</p>

<p>If I choose not to <code>inflate</code> my child image views from XML can I pass the <code>GestureDetector</code> as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of <code>ImageView</code> that I create?</p>

<h2>Method 1: A decorator</h2>
<pre><code>def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}

    return getinstance

class MyClass(BaseClass):

</code></pre>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();

<p>then <code>x == y</code> but <code>x != t &amp;&amp; y != t</code></p>

<h2>Method 2: A base class</h2>
<pre><code>class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):

        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a true class</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple inheritance - eugh! <code>__new__</code> could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Method 3: A <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python"">metaclass</a></h2>
<pre><code>class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)

<ul>
<li>It's a true class</li>
<li>Auto-magically covers inheritance</li>
<li>Uses <code>__metaclass__</code> for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name</h2>
<pre><code>def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):

<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a true class</li>
<li>Auto-magically covers inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...</li>
<li>What is the point of the <code>_sealed</code> attribute</li>
<li>Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using <code>super()</code> because they will recurse. This means you can't customize <code>__new__</code> and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to <code>__init__</code>.</li>
</ul>

"1678122","1678170","1267","257273","<p>Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse, or changed the location of the projects), <strong>almost all</strong> of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly, causing the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method must override a superclass method</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //These arguments have their correct names
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, 
                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 
    }

});

<p>will be initially populated like this:</p>

<pre><code>list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //This methods arguments were not automatically provided

                                    ContextMenuInfo arg3) {
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.</p>

<p>This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.</p>

<p>Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?</p>

"3492302","3492967","1177","280483","<p>I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q1</strong>: We have a bag containing numbers <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, …, <code>100</code>. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A1</strong>: Well, the sum of the numbers <code>1 + 2 + 3 + … + N</code> is <code>(N+1)(N/2)</code> (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_sum#Sum"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series</a>). For <code>N = 100</code>, the sum is <code>5050</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly <code>5050</code>. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in <code>O(N)</code> time and <code>O(1)</code> space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>: That is correct, but now how would you do this if <em>TWO</em> numbers are missing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.</p>
<p>The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: &quot;useful&quot;) programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.</p>
<p>The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find <em>k</em> missing numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Qk</strong>: If exactly <em>k</em> numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a <code>Ω(N)</code> time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the <em>TIME</em> and <em>SPACE</em> complexity of the solving technique (minus the <code>O(N)</code> time input scan) is defined in <em>k</em> not <em>N</em>.</p>
<p>So the question here is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you solve <strong>Q2</strong>?</li>
<li>How would you solve <strong>Q3</strong>?</li>
<li>How would you solve <strong>Qk</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Clarifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Generally there are <em>N</em> numbers from 1..<em>N</em>, not just 1..100.</li>
<li>I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array"" rel=""noreferrer"">bit set</a>, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using <code>O(N)</code> bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to <em>N</em>.</li>
<li>I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on <em>N</em>, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).</li>
</ul>
<p>So again, of course you must scan the input in <code>O(N)</code>, but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of <em>k</em> not <em>N</em>), and must then find the <em>k</em> missing numbers somehow.</p>

<p>However, I've never quite understood the differences between them -- how {<code>sapply</code>, <code>lapply</code>, etc.} apply the function to the input/grouped input, what the output will look like, or even what the input can be -- so I often just go through them all until I get what I want.</p>

<p>Can someone explain how to use which one when?</p>

<p>My current (probably incorrect/incomplete) understanding is...</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>sapply(vec, f)</code>: input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element <code>i</code> is <code>f(vec[i])</code>, giving you a matrix if <code>f</code> has a multi-element output</p></li>
<li><p><code>lapply(vec, f)</code>: same as <code>sapply</code>, but output is a list?</p></li>
<li><code>apply(matrix, 1/2, f)</code>: input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element <code>i</code> is f(row/col i of the matrix)</li>
<li><code>tapply(vector, grouping, f)</code>: output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of <code>f</code> at a grouping <code>g</code> of the vector, and <code>g</code> gets pushed to the row/col names</li>
<li><code>by(dataframe, grouping, f)</code>: let <code>g</code> be a grouping. apply <code>f</code> to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of <code>f</code> at each column.</li>
<li><code>aggregate(matrix, grouping, f)</code>: similar to <code>by</code>, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.</li>
</ol>

<p>Side question: I still haven't learned plyr or reshape -- would <code>plyr</code> or <code>reshape</code> replace all of these entirely?</p>

"14262433","14268804","1042","308577","<p>I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.</p>

<p>One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.</p>

<p>My first thought is to use <code>HDFStore</code> to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:</p>

<p>What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure</li>
<li>Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure</li>
<li>Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas</li>
</ol>

<p>Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".</p>

<p>Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.</li>
<li>In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.</li>
<li>I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.</li>
<li>I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.</p>

<p>Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.</li>
<li>Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, <code>if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'</code>.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.</li>
<li>Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.</li>
<li>A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.</li>
<li>It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.</li>
<li>The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).</p>

One article I found <a href=""http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">makes a fairly strong claim</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people I've met have read 
  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Design Patterns book</a> by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.</p>
  
  <p>Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. <strong>In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.</p>

<p>Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.</p>

<p>Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?</p>

<p>To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the <code>Dispose()</code> method is implemented to free <em>managed</em> resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by <code>MyCollection</code> any faster than it normally would?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that <code>_theList</code> in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory <em>now</em>, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;sum = &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            // Primary loop
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(&quot;sum = &quot; + sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>With a similar but less extreme result.</p>
<hr />
<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache"" rel=""noreferrer"">cache</a>, but then I thought how silly that was because the array was just generated.</p>

<p>This is a number of answers about warnings, errors, and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix them. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate adding to and maintaining this list.</p>
<h3>Why is this?</h3>
<p>Questions like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/12770075"">&quot;Headers already sent&quot;</a> or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/12769983"">&quot;Calling a member of a non-object&quot;</a> pop up frequently on Stack Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in their particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error cannot easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply.</p>
<h3>What should I do here?</h3>
<p>If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this one, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute, please add your &quot;favorite&quot; error message, warning or notice, one per answer, a short description what it means (even if it is only highlighting terms to their manual page), a possible solution or debugging approach and a listing of existing Q&amp;A that are of value.

<ul>
<li>I wanted to work with free/open-source tools.</li>
<li>I like Python and feel it's a <strong>long-term</strong> language, whereas regarding Ruby I wasn't sure, and PHP seemed like a huge hassle to learn.</li>
<li>I'm building a prototype for an idea and wasn't thinking too much about the future. Development speed was the main factor, and I already knew Python.</li>

<li>I heard Django was ""nice"".</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.</p>

<p>By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.</p>

<p>I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyError(Exception):
...     def __init__(self, message):
...         self.message = message
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; MyError(""foo"")
_sandbox.py:3: DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6
</code></pre>

<p>It seems crazy that <code>BaseException</code> has a special meaning for attributes named <code>message</code>. I gather from <A href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0352/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PEP-352</a> that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.</p>

<p>I'm also fuzzily aware that <code>Exception</code> has some magic parameter <code>args</code>, but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.</p>

<p>Update: two answers have suggested overriding <code>__init__</code>, and <code>__str__</code>/<code>__unicode__</code>/<code>__repr__</code>. That seems like a lot of typing, is it necessary?</p>

I was doing a naive search&nbsp;— picking one sock and ""iterating"" the pile in order to find its pair. This requires iterating over n/2 * n/4 = n<sup>2</sup>/8 socks on average.</p>

<p>As a computer scientist I was thinking what I could do? Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution.</p>

<p>Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).</p>

<p><strong>So, the question is basically:</strong></p>

<p>Given a pile of <code>n</code> pairs of socks, containing <code>2n</code> elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.)</p>

<p>I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>A general <em>theoretical</em> solution for a huge number of socks.</li>
<li>The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?)</li>

<pre><code>foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i =&gt; i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the <code>Where</code> clauses on the query to be based on the final value of <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>As explained <a href=""http://resnikb.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/c-lambda-and-foreach-variable/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, this happens because the <code>s</code> variable declared in <code>foreach</code> loop above is translated like this in the compiler:</p>

<pre><code>string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>instead of like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>As pointed out <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2388644/120955"">here</a>, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:</p>

<pre><code>string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;
</code></pre>

<p>However variables defined in a <code>foreach</code> loop cannot be used outside the loop:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.
</code></pre>

<p>So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.</p>

<p>Is there something you can do with <code>foreach</code> loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?</p>

<p>From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Interface:</strong></p>

<p>Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in a Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract Class:</strong></p>

<p>Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?</p></li>
<li><p>An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The memory model means that C++ code
  now has a standardized library to call
  regardless of who made the compiler
  and on what platform it's running.
  There's a standard way to control how
  different threads talk to the
  processor's memory.</p>
  
  <p>""When you are talking about splitting
  [code] across different cores that's
  in the standard, we are talking about
  the memory model. We are going to
  optimize it without breaking the
  following assumptions people are going
  to make in the code,"" <strong>Sutter</strong> said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I can <em>memorize</em> this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.</p>

<p>C++ programmers used to develop multi-threaded applications even before, so how does it matter if it's POSIX threads, or Windows threads, or C++11 threads? What are the benefits? I want to understand the low-level details.</p>

<p>I also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related?</p>

<p>As I don't know how the internals of multi-threading work, and what memory model means in general, please help me understand these concepts. :-)</p>

<li>To add suffix S to the tree, I need to iterate through each character in S, with the iterations consisting of either walking down an existing branch that starts with the same set of characters C in S and potentially splitting an edge into descendent nodes when I reach a differing character in the suffix, OR if there was no matching edge to walk down. When no matching edge is found to walk down for C, a new leaf edge is created for C.</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic algorithm appears to be O(n<sup>2</sup>), as is pointed out in most explanations, as we need to step through all of the prefixes, then we need to step through each of the suffixes for each prefix. Ukkonen's algorithm is apparently unique because of the suffix pointer technique he uses, though I think <em>that</em> is what I'm having trouble understanding.</p>

<p>I'm also having trouble understanding:</p>

<ul>
<li>exactly when and how the ""active point"" is assigned, used and changed</li>
<li>what is going on with the canonization aspect of the algorithm</li>
<li>Why the implementations I've seen need to ""fix"" bounding variables that they are using</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Here is the completed <strong>C#</strong> source code. It not only works correctly, but supports automatic canonization and renders a nicer looking text graph of the output. Source code and sample output is at:</p>

<p><strong>Update 2017-11-04</strong></p>

<p>After many years I've found a new use for suffix trees, and have implemented the algorithm in <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Gist is below. It should be bug-free. Dump it into a js file, <code>npm install chalk</code> from the same location, and then run with node.js to see some colourful output. There's a stripped down version in the same Gist, without any of the debugging code.</p>

"6430448","6430525","2166","208418","<p>I am doing some numerical optimization on a scientific application. One thing I noticed is that GCC will optimize the call <code>pow(a,2)</code> by compiling it into <code>a*a</code>, but the call <code>pow(a,6)</code> is not optimized and will actually call the library function <code>pow</code>, which greatly slows down the performance. (In contrast, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_C++_Compiler"">Intel C++ Compiler</a>, executable <code>icc</code>, will eliminate the library call for <code>pow(a,6)</code>.) </p>

<p>What I am curious about is that when I replaced <code>pow(a,6)</code> with <code>a*a*a*a*a*a</code> using GCC 4.5.1 and options ""<code>-O3 -lm -funroll-loops -msse4</code>"", it uses 5 <code>mulsd</code> instructions:</p>

<pre><code>movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
</code></pre>

<p>while if I write <code>(a*a*a)*(a*a*a)</code>, it will produce</p>

<pre><code>movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm13, %xmm13
</code></pre>

<p>which reduces the number of multiply instructions to 3. <code>icc</code> has similar behavior.</p>

<p>But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page.

<p>Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(</p>

<p>Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.</p>

<p>The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.</p>

<p>I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(</p>

"7726949","28464339","1340","526229","<p>Is there a simple way to delete all tracking branches whose remote equivalent no longer exists?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Branches (local and remote)</p>

<ul>
<li>master</li>
<li>origin/master</li>
<li>origin/bug-fix-a</li>
<li>origin/bug-fix-b</li>
<li>origin/bug-fix-c</li>
</ul>

<p>Locally, I only have a master branch. Now I need to work on <em>bug-fix-a</em>, so I check it out, work on it, and push changes to the remote. Next I do the same with <em>bug-fix-b</em>.</p>

<p>Branches (local and remote)</p>

<ul>
<li>master</li>
<li>bug-fix-a</li>
<li>bug-fix-b</li>
<li>origin/master</li>
<li>origin/bug-fix-a</li>
<li>origin/bug-fix-b</li>
<li>origin/bug-fix-c</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I have local branches <em>master</em>, <em>bug-fix-a</em>, <em>bug-fix-b</em>. The Master branch maintainer will merge my changes into <em>master</em> and delete all branches he has already merged.</p>

<p>So the current state is now:</p>

<li>bug-fix-b</li>
<li>origin/master</li>
<li>origin/bug-fix-c</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I would like to call some command to delete branches (in this case <em>bug-fix-a</em>, <em>bug-fix-b</em>), which are no longer represented in the remote repository.</p>

<p>It would be something like the existing command <code>git remote prune origin</code>, but more like <code>git local prune origin</code>.</p>

"12506897","","1081","141387","<p>Since the upgrade to iOS 6, we are seeing Safari's web view take the liberty of caching <code>$.ajax</code> calls. This is in the context of a PhoneGap application so it is using the Safari WebView. Our <code>$.ajax</code> calls are <code>POST</code> methods and we have cache set to false <code>{cache:false}</code>, but still this is happening. We tried manually adding a <code>TimeStamp</code> to the headers but it did not help.</p>

<p>We did more research and found that Safari is only returning cached results for web services that have a function signature that is static and does not change from call to call.  For instance, imagine a function called something like:</p>

<pre><code>getNewRecordID(intRecordType)
</code></pre>

<p>This function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.</p>

<p>Must be in Apple's haste to make iOS 6 zip along impressively they got too happy with the cache settings.  Has anyone else seen this behavior on iOS 6? If so, what exactly is causing it?</p>

<hr>

<p>The workaround that we found was to modify the function signature to be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>getNewRecordID(intRecordType, strTimestamp)
</code></pre>

<p>and then always pass in a <code>TimeStamp</code> parameter as well, and just discard that value on the server side.  This works around the issue.  I hope this helps some other poor soul who spends 15 hours on this issue like I did!</p>

"21692193","21694054","1463","194040","<p>When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:</p>

<pre><code>var football_team = new List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;();
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a <code>string</code> representing the name of the team, etc..</p>

<p>So then I think:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a <code>string</code>) and a running total of scores (an <code>int</code>). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is <code>List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;</code>, so I will inherit from it:</p>

<pre><code>class FootballTeam : List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But it turns out that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/5376343/1042555"">a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.</p>

<h2>Why not?</h2>

<p>Apparently <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/5376358/1042555""><code>List</code> is somehow optimized for performance</a>. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend <code>List</code>? What exactly will break?</p>

<p>Another reason I've seen is that <code>List</code> is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5376203/inherit-listt#comment6077237_5376343"">I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API""</a>. But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from <code>List</code> <em>and</em> it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?</p>

<p>Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?</p>

<p>And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from <code>List</code>, why didn't they make the class <code>sealed</code>?</p>

<h2>What else am I supposed to use?</h2>

<p>Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a <code>Collection</code> class which should be extended instead of <code>List</code>. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1474863/addrange-to-a-collection"">such as <code>AddRange</code></a>, for instance. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/12039943/1042555"">jvitor83's answer</a> provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow <code>AddRange</code> not better than no <code>AddRange</code>?</p>

<p>Inheriting from <code>Collection</code> is way more work than inheriting from <code>List</code>, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting <code>Collection</code> is actually not the right solution for my problem.</p>

<p>I've seen suggestions such as implementing <code>IList</code>. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.</p>

<p>Lastly, some suggest wrapping the <code>List</code> in something: </p>

<pre><code>class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are two problems with this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call <code>my_team.Players.Count</code> instead of just <code>my_team.Count</code>. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal <code>List</code>... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?</p></li>
<li><p>It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It <em>is</em> the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.</p>

<h2>My question (summarized)</h2>

<p>What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a <code>list</code> of <code>things</code> with a few bells and whistles?</p>

<p>Is inheriting from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> or not?</p>

This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of ""this is how you loop an array with <code>foreach</code>"".</p>

<hr>

<p>For a long time I assumed that <code>foreach</code> worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.</p>

<p>Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:</p>

<pre><code>$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 1</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  $array[] = $item;
}
print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p>This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/nirz6Ufh"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 2</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */
</code></pre>

<p>This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. <em>But...</em></p>

<p>If we look in the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">manual</a>, we find this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right... this seems to suggest that <code>foreach</code> relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're <em>not working with the source array</em>, right? Well, not entirely.</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/6n20ooMy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 3</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop
var_dump(each($array));

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

var_dump(each($array));

/* Output
  array(4) {
    [1]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [""value""]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [0]=&gt;
    int(0)
    [""key""]=&gt;
    int(0)
  }
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  bool(false)
*/
</code></pre>

<p>So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then <a href=""http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9"" rel=""noreferrer"">test case 1</a> would loop forever.</p>

<p>The PHP manual also states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, let's find out what that ""unexpected behavior"" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/JJp79xSd"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 4</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  each($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/IfwJyTCL"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 5</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  reset($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p>...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the ""copy of source"" theory.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p>What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.</p>

<p>It seems to me that <code>foreach</code> works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this correct and the whole story?</li>
<li>If not, what is it really doing?</li>
<li>Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (<code>each()</code>, <code>reset()</code> et al.) during a <code>foreach</code> could affect the outcome of the loop?</li>
</ul>

<li><code>*args</code> = list of arguments - as positional arguments</li>
<li><code>**kwargs</code> = dictionary - whose keys become separate keyword arguments and the values become values of these arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't understand what programming task this would be helpful for. </p>

<p>Maybe:</p>

<p>I think to enter lists and dictionaries as arguments of a function AND at the same time as a wildcard, so I can pass ANY argument?</p>

<p>Is there a simple example to explain how <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code> are used?</p>

<p>Also the tutorial I found used just the ""*"" and a variable name. </p>

<p>Are <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code> just placeholders or do you use exactly <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code> in the code?</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>nvm ls

I've tried uninstalling npm and reinstalling it following <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/268946/uninstall-node-js"">these</a> instructions.</p>

<p>All of this because I was trying to update an older version of node to install the ""zipstream"" library. Now there's folders in my users directory, and the node version STILL isn't up to date, even though NVM says it's using 0.6.19.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find any information on this, but it appears to be a rather important part of Node.js as I often see it in source code.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.2/api/globals.html#module"" rel=""noreferrer"">Node.js documentation</a>:</p>

<p><strong>module</strong></p>
<p>A reference to the current

is the same as the exports object. See
<code>src/node.js</code> for more information.</p>

<p>Is there any way to connect to this MySql or any other program on localhost from within this docker container?</p>

<p>This question is different from ""How to get the IP address of the docker host from inside a docker container"" due to the fact that the IP address of the docker host could be the public IP or the private IP in the network which may or may not be reachable from within the docker container (I mean public IP if hosted at AWS or something). Even if you have the IP address of the docker host it does not mean you can connect to docker host from within the container given that IP address as your Docker network may be overlay, host, bridge, macvlan, none etc which restricts the reachability of that IP address.</p>

<p>Not sure why the latest installer puts this in <code>/Library</code> instead of <code>/System/Library</code> (nor what the difference is). But <code>/usr/libexec/java_home</code> doesn't find 1.8, so all the posts I've found on how to set your current java version don't work. I've tried adding a symbolic link to make it look like 1.8 is in the <code>/System/Library...</code> path, but it doesn't help. <code>/usr/libexec/java_home -V</code> still only lists the old Java 1.6.</p>

<p>Ironically, the ""Java"" control panel under System Preferences shows only Java 1.8!</p>
